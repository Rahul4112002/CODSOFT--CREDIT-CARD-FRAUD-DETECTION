## Overview

Fraudulent activities in credit card transactions pose significant challenges. This project employs machine learning techniques, primarily Random Forest, to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on historical data patterns. The goal is to build a predictive model that can effectively identify fraudulent transactions, thus aiding in fraud prevention.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle at [Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data). It contains a collection of credit card transactions with labeled data indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. 

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Start the Flask server:
    ```
    python app.py
    ```
3. Access the web application through a browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Results

The Random Forest model trained on the provided dataset achieved an accuracy of 99.6%` in detecting fraudulent transactions. Further details about precision, recall, and F1-score can be found within the code or documentation.
